OpenCV based computer vision for Eurobot2014

Compilation:
(you need to have installed OpenCV)

    - mkdir build
    - cd build
    - cmake .. -DOn_Robot=On
    - make
    - cd ..

    Note:
    - please use the name 'build' for the folder where you invoke cmake
      since the python wrapper has the destination for the generated
      dynamic library hard-coded
    - if you want to compile the version with debug output on your computer
      you can leave out the '-DOn_Robot=On' part of the cmake command, since
      it is off by default
    - cmake caches some arguments, if you change the command line option but see
      no change in behaviour clean the whole build directory and recompile
